        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Originally from Cincinnati, OH, and now living in Los Angeles, CA, I'm an aspiring developer with a background in Audio Engineering, Music Recording, and designing Interactive Music Systems for video games. I've had the pleasure of working with such a variety of teams in different environments and disciplines; problem-solving and bringing a fresh perspective to the table are my specialty! <br><br> Music has been a major part of my life since I was a child; starting from playing piano when I was 6, up to touring multiple states in the Midwest and East Coast playing Double Bass in multiple ensembles. This passion led me to study audio engineering and music production at my Alma Mater: Ohio University in Athens, OH. <br><br>After college, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in recording music for film, TV, and video games. I found my home at Sony PlayStation; working as a Music Engineer to help record, edit, and mix soundtracks for AAA games. Throughout my time, I began gaining more skills, and while doing music engineering I started dipping my toes into the world of implementation. I worked with music editors, programmers, and project leads to help design and implement interactive music systems. <br><br>I fell in love with designing systems and getting into the technical side of video games. After parting ways with Sony, I found myself wanting to develop applications and tools...and here we are! I'm now working towards being a certified full stack web developer. My past experiences and roles give me a unique insight into the world of programming and have sharpened my abilities for working out complex problems. <br><br> Please find my contact information at the bottom of the page - I look forward to meeting you!</p>
