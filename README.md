# Module 02 Challenge

## Description

The main goal of this challenge was to create a portfolio page for myself to help prospective employers view information about me, my work, and how to get in contact. Having a clean, organized, and functional portfolio page is crucial to make a good first impression on whomever is accessing the page. To achieve that result, I needed to have great attention to detail in how I structured the HTML document, styled page elements in CSS, and maintaining good accesibility standards.

The page features a photograph of myself, an "about me" section that gives some information on my previous roles and background, an interactive section featuring examples of my work, and a simple contact information section. After a user is finished viewing this page, they should leave with a good overview of who I am, and the work that I've done.

While building this web page, I learned how to utilize new attributes for the pseudo-class "hover:" the image tiles appear to "brighten" when the user hovers over each image, and users can also click each image to be directed to that application. Another thing I learned was how best to overlay text on top of an HTML image element (instead of using a CSS background image). Additionally, I sharpened my ability in utilizing flexbox layouts to organize elements on the page while completing this challenge.

Once on the page, users may scroll throughout the page to view the different sections, or they can click the navigation links in the header - 
* "About me" will auto-scroll the page to a section with text information about my background and previous roles
* "My Work" will auto-scroll the page to a section that features examples of my past work. Users can click each image to be taken to the deployed project.
* "Contact Me" will auto-scroll the page to a section that details different contact methods to get in touch with me. There is also a link to my GitHub page and my Instagram.
